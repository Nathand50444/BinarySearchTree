## Binary Search Tree (BST) in Ruby

# Overview
This repository contains a Ruby implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST). A Binary Search Tree is a data structure that provides efficient methods for inserting, searching, and deleting elements while maintaining an ordered structure.

The main features of a BST include:

* Efficient Searching: Elements in a BST can be quickly located due to the tree's ordered nature.
* Balanced Structure: Operations such as insertion and deletion attempt to keep the tree balanced, optimising performance.

# Implementation Details
The BST is implemented using two main classes: Tree and Node.

Node Class: Represents each individual node within the tree.
Tree Class: Manages the overall tree structure and provides methods for insertion, deletion, traversal, and rebalancing.

# How to Use

1. Clone the Repository.
2. Run the Ruby file './main.rb' in the irb.
3. Change instructions as required.
